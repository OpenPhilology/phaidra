			<h1>Welcome!</h1>

			<p>We are trying to test which methods of teaching Ancient Greek are most effective and engaging for learners. You can help us by spending a little time with our eLearning environment. In the process, you'll get to interact with text directly from Thucydides' <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em>, a historical account of the battles fought between the Athenians and the Spartans during the 5th century BC.</p>

			<p>At any point, you can click the <strong><u>Skip to Survey</u></strong> link at the top of the screen. Please be sure to do this before exiting, so we can ask you a couple of closing questions.</p>

			<p><strong>Click the red top right corner of the screen to start!</strong></p>
