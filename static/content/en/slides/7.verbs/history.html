		<h2>...previously in the Pentecontaetia</h2>

			Themistocles revealed to the Spartans the truth about the wall. 
		</p>
		<h2>Now in the Pentecontaetia...</h2>
		<p>The wall is completed in a very short period of time, for the foundations are laid with stones of all kinds, pieces of columns, tombs, and sculptures. <span class= "greek-text masc">ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς</span>, Themistocles, insists that the Piraeus, the port of Athens, is also fortified. He, in fact, can foresee the great power that Athens will gain by being a city of naval people.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, while the Spartans are still supreme among <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Ἕλληνες</span>, the Hellenes, the Spartan military leader Pausanias leads <span class= "greek-text neut">τό ναυτικόν</span>, a fleet of fifty Greek ships and conquers Cyprus and Byzantium.</p>
