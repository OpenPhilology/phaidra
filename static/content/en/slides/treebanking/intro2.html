		<h2>Building Parse Trees for Nouns</h2>

		<hr>

		<h3>What's the next step?</h3>
		<p>
			Then, you can start giving your tree branches. A particularly important branch is the <strong>subject (SUBJ)</strong> of the sentence. The subject depends on the PRED and often describes who/what performs the action of the sentence. The SUBJ is often a noun. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The subject is usually in the nominative case, but you will learn that in a few other constructions it can also be in the genitive or accusative case.

			<h3>Try it yourself!</h3>
			<p>
				<ol>	
					<li>Click on the SUBJ word circle. The SUBJ circle is always blue.</li>
					<li>Then click on the PRED circle, on which the SUBJ depends.</li>
					<li>If the circles fill up with color, your tree is complete!</li>
