		<h2>Building Parse Trees for Nouns</h2>

		<hr>

		<h3>What's the final step?</h3>
		<p>
			In order to build complete basic trees, the last thing you should learn about it  are <strong>adverbials (ADV)</strong>. ADVs specify the circumstances under which an event expressed by a verb takes place. An ADV can be an <em>adverb</em>, a <em>prepositional phrase</em>, <em>participle</em> or <em>subordinate clause</em>. In a tree the ADV will depend on the word to which it is referred. Remember, ADV are always optional constituents, in the sense that a sentence can have some meaning even without them (which does not mean that they are not important, but that you can conceive of a context where they might be left out).

				<ol>	
					<li>Click on the ADV word circle.</li>
					<li>Then click on the PRED circle, on which the ADV depends.</li>
					<li>If the circles fill up with color, your tree is complete!</li>
					<li>Create any other dependencies you see.</li>
