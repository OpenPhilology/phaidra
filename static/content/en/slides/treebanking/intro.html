		<h2>Building Parse Trees for Nouns</h2>

		<hr>

		<h3>What's a parse tree, you ask?</h3>
		<p>
			A <strong>parse tree</strong> is a way to represent that you understand the grammar and function of a Greek sentence. The act of building parse trees is called <strong>treebanking</strong>.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
		<p>
			Treebanking can really help you understand the meaning of difficult sentences and, by building parse trees, you can store your interpretation of any sentence so that both yourself and other scholars can benefit from it in the future! 
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h3>So, how does it work?</h3>
		<p>
			Just imagine a tree that hangs upside down – that’s what your parse tree will look like. The trees can be big or small and have many or few branches, depending on the length of the sentence.
