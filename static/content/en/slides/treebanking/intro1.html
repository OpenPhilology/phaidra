		<h2>Building Parse Trees for Nouns</h2>

		<hr>

		<h3>Let's get started, shall we?</h3>
		<p>
			It all starts with the <strong>root</strong>. The root is the starting point on which you build the tree. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When you have taken a good look at the sentence you are working on, you must identify the trunk of your tree. This is called the <strong>predicate (PRED)</strong>. The PRED is a word in the sentence that does not depend on any other word and around which the sentence revolves. The PRED is the verb of a sentence, as it shapes the form of the main constituents in the sentence.

			<p>Identifying the PRED is the first step to building your own tree! The PRED will always appear as a red circle.</p>
