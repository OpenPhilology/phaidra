The Athenians, now free from the Hellenic war, decide to send 200 vessels towars Cyprus, 60 of which headed to Egypt. The ships are lead by  <span lang="grc" class= "greek-text masc">Κίμων</span>, Cimon, who lays siege at Citium. Cimon dies shortly after, due to lack of provisions and the whole army leaves Citium and reunites with the vessels who had gone to Egypt. During their return they are attacked by Phoenicians, Cyprians and Cilicians, but they manage to defeat them!</p>
		<p>In the meantime, the Spartans become masters of Delphi, but are soon sent away by the Athenians!</p>
