		<h2>Now in the Pentecontaetia...</h2>
		<p>The Helots finally surrender to Sparta on condition that they leave <span class="greek-text fem">ἡ Πελοπόννησος</span>, the Peloponnesus, and never return. The Spartans have, in fact, received an oracle from Delphi instructing exactly this. The Helots are received by the Athenians, who place them at Naupactus. A dispute with Corinth leads <span class="greek-text fem">ἡ Μεγάρη</span>, Megara, to ally herself with Athens.</p> 
		<p>Meanwhile, <span class="greek-text masc">ὁ βασιλεὺς</span>, the king of the Libyans on the Egyptian border, Inaros, causes a revolt of almost the whole of Egypt against the Persians. He invites the Athenians to assist him. The Athenians immediately sail to Egypt and enter through the Nile. They quickly establish themselves themselves as masters of the river.</p>
