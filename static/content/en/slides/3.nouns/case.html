		<h2>Case</h2>
		<div class="speech">
			<p>The last &mdash; but arguably most important &mdash; thing to remember about Greek nouns is that their ending changes according to the case they are in. The case of a Greek noun indicates its grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence (i.e., subject, direct object, etc.).</p>

		</div>
		<hr>

		<h3>Example</h3> 
		<blockquote>
			<em>Thucydides describes the war.</em>		
		</blockquote>

		<p><u>Thucydides</u> is the <strong>subject or nominative</strong> of the verb <u>describes</u>, while <u>the war</u> is the <strong>direct object or accusative</strong> of the sentence.
		</p>

		<hr>

		In Greek there are <strong>5 main cases</strong>:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Nominative</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Accusative</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Genitive</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Dative</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Vocative</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			In Greek, the <u>ending of a noun</u> will always indicate which case it is in. Indeed, both the definite article of a noun and the noun's ending will vary according to case. The stem of the noun, however, always remains the same.
