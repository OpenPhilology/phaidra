		<h2>Characteristics of Greek Nouns</h2>
		<p>Every Greek noun will have these 3 important characteristics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Gender</strong>: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter</li>
				<li> <strong>Number</strong>: Singular or Plural</li>
				<li> <strong>Case</strong>: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative or Vocative</li>
			</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3>Cases in English</h3>
		<p> While Gender and Number may be easy concepts to grasp, Case can be tricky for uninflected-language speakers. Case indicates the change in the ending of a word according to its function in the sentence. Though English is largely uninflected, some words do change according to their function.</p>

		
		<h4>Example</h4> 
		<blockquote>
			<em><strong>Who</strong> am I?</em>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			"Who" is in the <strong>nominative</strong> case, because it is the subject.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<em>I have seen the man <strong>whom</strong> I admire.</em>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			"Whom" is in <strong>accusative</strong> case, because it is the direct object.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, English adds an "m" to indicate how "who" functions in the sentence. With an "m", it's the direct object, without, it's the subject.

			<em>English also does this with personal pronouns: <strong>She</strong> walks the dog (subject), or does the dog walk <strong>her</strong>? (direct object)</em>
