		<h4>Pluperfect Indicative Active</h4>
	
		<p>
			As you remember from "Introduction to Verbs":
			<ul>	
				<li>The<strong>pluperfect tense</strong>Describes an action in the past time with completed aspect (i.e. fixed moment in time that has come to an end).</li>
				<li>The<strong>indicative mood</strong>is used for factual statements and questions.</li>
				<li>The<strong>active voice</strong>means the subject of the verb is performing the action.</li>
			</ul>

		</p>
		<p>
			Here are some examples of the aorist in English: <em><strong>I had seen</strong> it in the past.</em>

			<h5>Keep an eye out!</h5>
			Remember that unlike English verbs, the subject of the Greek verb is implied by the verb's ending. Therefore, it is not necessary for it to be accompanied by the personal pronouns <em>I, You, He/She/It, We, You, They</em>.
