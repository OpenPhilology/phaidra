		<strong>Are you wondering what those words above the circles mean?</strong> They indicate the relations between words. It may help you to become familiar with just a few of these. <strong>Pred</strong> describes the predicate - the verb of the sentence (for example, watch). <strong>Subj</strong> is the subeject: it depends on the <em>Pred</em> and often describes who/what performs the action of the sentence (for example, gods). <strong>Obj</strong> is the object: it depends on the <em>Pred</em> and represents the element in the sentence that is being acted upon (for example, men). And <strong>Atr</strong> describes the attribute, or a descriptive element in the sentence, which could be an article or adjective that depends on a noun (for example, The or all). It's that easy!
