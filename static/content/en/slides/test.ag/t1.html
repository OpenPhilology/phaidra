		Build your own parse tree! A parse tree is a way to show that you understand the grammar and function of a Greek sentence. Treebanking can really help you make sense of the meaning of difficult Greek sentences. The root is the starting point on which you build the "upside-down" tree. All you have to do it figure out which words in the sentence "depend" on other words. Take the English sentence: <em>The man eats an apple.</em> The action verb of the sentences is <em>eats</em>, while the subject is <em>man</em>. The object is <em>apple</em>. Therefore, <em>man</em> and <em>apple</em> depend on <em>eats</em>. The article <em>The</em> depends on the word <em>man</em>, so in a tree it would be placed under it.
