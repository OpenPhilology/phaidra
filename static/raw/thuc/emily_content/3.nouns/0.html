<h4>How Greek nouns work</h4>

<p <p style= "text-align: justify"> Just like many modern languages (for example, German and Russian) Greek is an <strong>inflected</strong> language, meaning that the endings of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and verbs change to reflect their relationship with other words.</p> 

<p>Every Greek noun will have these 3 important characteristics:  
	<ol>
		<li> <strong>Gender</strong>: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter</li>
		<li> <strong>Number</strong>: Singular or Plural</li>
		<li> <strong>Case</strong>: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, or Vocative</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p <p style= "text-align: justify"> While gender and number may be easy concepts to grasp, case can be tricky for uninflected-language speakers. Case indicates the change in the ending of a word according to its function in the sentence. Though English is largely uninflected, some words do change according to their function. For example: <em>I have seen the man <u>whom</u> I admire.</em> 'Whom' is the <strong>accusative</strong> (direct object form) of 'who'.

<p>Take, for example, the Greek word for "day":</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center">
		<div class="greek-text fem" style="font-size: 36px">ἡ ἡμέρα</div>
		The Day
	</div>
	<div class="panel-footer" style="text-align: center">
		By looking at <span class="greek-text fem">ἡ ἡμέρα</span>, you may already identify its 3 characteristics: it is <u>Feminine</u>, <u>Singular</u>, and <u>Nominative</u>. 
	</div>
</div>
