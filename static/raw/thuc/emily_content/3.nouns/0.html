<h4>How Greek nouns work</h4>

<p>Just like many modern languages (for example, German and Russian) Greek is an <strong>inflected</strong> language, meaning that the endings of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and verbs change to reflect their relationship with other words.</p> 

<p>The first thing to remember is that you nouns will always have these 3 important elements:  
	<ol>
		<li> <strong>Gender</strong>: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter</li>
		<li> <strong>Number</strong>: Singular or Plural</li>
		<li> <strong>Case</strong>: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, or Vocative</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>Take, for example, the greek word for "day":</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center">
		<div class="greek-text fem" style="font-size: 36px">ἡ ἡμέρα</div>
		The Day
	</div>
	<div class="panel-footer" style="text-align: center">
		By looking at <span class="greek-text fem">ἡ ἡμέρα</span>, we already know this noun is <u>Feminine</u>, <u>Singular</u>, and <u>Nominative</u> even without knowing its definition.
	</div>
</div>
