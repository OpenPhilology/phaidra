<h4>Case</h4>
<p>
	The last thing to remember about Greek nouns is that their ending changes according to the case they are in. Cases indicate the function of word in a sentence. <p>Take the example: <em>Thucydides describes the war</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Thucydides</em> is the <strong>subject or nominative</strong> of the verb <em>describes</em>, while <em>the war</em> is the <strong>object or accusative</strong> of the sentence.
</p>

In Greek there are <strong>5 main cases</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Nominative</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Accusative</strong></li>
	
	<li><strong>Genitive</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Dative</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Vocative</strong></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The <strong>ending of a noun</strong> will always indicate which case it is in. Both a noun and its corresponding definite article will vary according to case. Though you haven't learnt what each case represents, it would be useful for you to first familiarize with the <strong>Greek articles</strong>, in order to make the next lesson - "Introduction to cases" - easier to understand.

<p class="alert alert-info">
	In this lesson you have learnt that:
	<ul>
		<li>Greek nouns have a gender (feminine, masculine or neuter)</li>
		<li>Greek nouns have a number singular or plural)</li>
		<li>Greek nouns have a case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative or vocative)</li>
		<li>When Greek nouns are preceded by a definite article, they will take the same gender, number and case as the article itself</li> 
	</ul>
