		<h2>How Greek Nouns Work</h2>

		<p>Just like many modern languages (for example, German and Russian) <strong>Greek is an inflected language</strong>, meaning that the <strong>endings of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and verbs change to reflect their relationship with other words</strong>.</p> 

		<hr>

		<h3>The Characteristics of a Greek Noun</h3>
		<p>Every Greek noun will have these 3 important characteristics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Gender</strong>: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter</li>
				<li> <strong>Number</strong>: Singular or Plural</li>
				<li> <strong>Case</strong>: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative or Vocative</li>
			</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3>Cases in English</h3>
		<p> While gender and number may be easy concepts to grasp, case can be tricky for uninflected-language speakers. Case indicates the change in the ending of a word according to its function in the sentence. Though English is largely uninflected, some words do change according to their function.</p>

			<h5>Example</h5> 
			<em>I have seen the man <u>whom</u> I admire.</em>
			<hr>
			'Whom' is the <strong>accusative</strong> (direct object form) of 'who'.

		<p>Take, for example, the Greek word for "day":</p>
		<div class="panel panel-default">
			<div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center">
				<div lang="grc" class="fem" style="font-size: 36px">ἡ ἡμέρα</div>
				The Day
			</div>
			<div class="panel-footer">
				By looking at <span lang="grc" class="fem">ἡ ἡμέρα</span>, you may already identify its 3 characteristics:<br><br> 

				<ol>
					<li> Gender: <u>Feminine</u></li>
					<li> Number: <u>Singular</u></li>
					<li> Case: <u>Nominative</u></li>
				</ol>
