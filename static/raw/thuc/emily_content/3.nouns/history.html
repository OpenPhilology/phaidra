		<h2>Who is Thucydides?</h2>

 
		<p style= "text-align: justify">
			Thucydides (circa 460 BC to 395 BC) was born in the great city of Athens. He was <span lang="grc" class="masc">ὁ ἀνήρ ᾿Αθηναῖος</span>, an Athenian man. At the age of 30, Thucydides survived the plague of Athens, a devastating epidemic that killed many citizens. He was sent to the island of Thasos soon after as <span lang="grc" class="masc">ὁ στρατηγός</span>, a general for the Athenian army.

			In the winter of that year, the city of Amphipolis was lost to <span lang="grc" class="masc">οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι</span>, the Spartans, after an attack. Thucydides was blamed for this defeat and sent into exile. He became a wanderer and traveled among the allies of <span lang="grc" class="fem">ἡ Πελοπόννησος</span>, the Peloponnesus &mdash; the large peninsula forming the south of Greece.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p style= "text-align: justify">
			In this capacity he observed the conflicts that had begun between the cities of Athens and Sparta in 431 BC from the perspectives of both sides. Thucydides was later called the father of 'scientific history' because he related the causes and effects of the war in a factual manner with no reference to the gods, as he himself outlines in the introduction to his work.
