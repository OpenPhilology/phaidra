<h2>Case</h2>
<p>The last thing to remember about Greek nouns is that their ending changes according to the case they are in. The case of a Greek noun indicates its grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence (i.e., subject, direct object, etc.).</p>

<div class="bg-info">
	<h5>Example</h5> 
	<em>Thucydides describes the war.</em>		

	<p><u>Thucydides</u> is the <strong>subject or nominative</strong> of the verb <u>describes</u>, while <u>the war</u> is the <strong>direct object or accusative</strong> of the sentence.
	</p>
</div>

In Greek there are <strong>5 main cases</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Nominative</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Accusative</strong></li>
	
	<li><strong>Genitive</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Dative</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Vocative</strong></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	In Greek, the <u>ending of a noun</u> will always indicate which case it is in. Indeed, both the definite article of a noun and the noun's ending will vary according to case. The stem of the noun, however, always remains the same.
