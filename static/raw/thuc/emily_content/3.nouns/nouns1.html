		<h2>Characteristics of Greek Nouns</h2>
		<p>Every Greek noun will have these 3 important characteristics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Gender</strong>: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter</li>
				<li> <strong>Number</strong>: Singular or Plural</li>
				<li> <strong>Case</strong>: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative or Vocative</li>
			</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3>Cases in English</h3>
		<p> While gender and number may be easy concepts to grasp, case can be tricky for uninflected-language speakers. Case indicates the change in the ending of a word according to its function in the sentence. Though English is largely uninflected, some words do change according to their function.</p>

			<em>I have seen the man <u>whom</u> I admire.</em>
			<hr>
			'Whom' is the <strong>accusative</strong> (direct object form) of 'who'.
