		<h4>Let's look at some historical facts.</h4>

 
		<p>
			So, you learnt that Thucydides is the author of the History of the Peloponnesian War, the story of the great <span class= "greek-text masc">ὁ πόλεμος</span> the war, fought between the Peloponnesian League, led by <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι</span>, the Spartans, and the Delian League, led by <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ ᾿Αθηναῖοι</span>, the Athenians. 
As you go through the lessons you will become particularly familiar with one part of Thucydides' great historical account - a section of the first book called <span class= "greek-text fem">ἡ πεντηκονταετία</span>, the Pentecontaetia.

		</p>
		<p>
			Can you guess the meaning of Pentecontaetia? The word is a combination of πεντηκοντα meaning fifty and ετία meaning age. The fifty year age marks the period between the defeat of the second Persian invasion of Greece in 479 BC and the beginning of the Peloponnesian war in 433 BC, when Athens was gradually becoming the most powerful state in the Greek world. Athens was in fact building its empire and exercised control over the allies with its fierce <span class= "greek-text fem">ἡ στρατιά</span>, its army, named the Delian League.
