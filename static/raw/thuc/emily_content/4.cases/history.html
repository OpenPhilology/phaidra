				The word is a combination of <span class="greek-text">πεντήκοντα</span> meaning fifty and <span class="greek-text">ετία</span> meaning age.

Athens was in fact building its empire and exercised control over the allies with its fierce <span class= "greek-text fem">ἡ στρατιά</span>, its army, named the Delian League.
