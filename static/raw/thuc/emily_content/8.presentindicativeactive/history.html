			Pausanias won Cyprus and Byzantium with the help of fifty Greek ships.
		</p>
		 <h4>Now in the Pentecontaetia...</h4>
		<p>
			Pausanias grows arrogant and unpopular among <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Ἕλληνες</span>, the Hellenes because he is acting more like a despot than a general. The Greek allies request that the leadership be handed to the Athenians. On his return to Sparta, Pausanias is tried for his acts of oppression, but acquitted and found not guilty. However, he is not restored to his command and <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι</span>, the Spartans do not return into battle. 
As the new leaders, the Athenians form a new anti-Persian alliance and determine which Greek cities are to contribute money and ships against them.
