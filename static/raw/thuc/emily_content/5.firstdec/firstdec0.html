		<h4>What is a declension?</h4>
		<p style= "text-align: justify">
			A declension is a group of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and articles that follow a particular <strong>pattern of inflection</strong>.
There are 3 declensions in Greek. Each noun belongs to only one declension and can only have the endings that belong to that particular declension. Those nouns whose endings are (for the most part) the vowels <span class="greek-text">-α or -η</span>, belong to the <strong>first declension</strong>. Those nouns ending in <span class="greek-text">-ο</span> belong to the <strong>second declension</strong>. All the other nouns belong to the <strong>third declension</strong>.

The vocabulary entry for each noun shows the nominative and the genitive forms, the definite article and the English meaning. For example: "<span class="greek-text fem">χώρα, ας ἡ</span>...land, country". 
<br></br>
To decline any noun, take the <strong>genitive singular</strong>, remove the ending to get the stem, and then add the right set of endings to the stem.
