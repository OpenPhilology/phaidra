		<h2>The very beginning of the Pentecontaetia.</h2>

		<p>
			The Pentecontaetia starts when <span lang="grc" class="masc">οἱ Ἕλληνες</span>, the Hellenes, finally defeat the Persians at Mycale.
		</p>
		<p style= "text-align:justify">
			As the conflict ends, both the Persians and the Hellenes gradually make their way home. Upon their return, <span lang="grc" class="masc">οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι</span>, the Athenians, decide to rebuild their <span lang="grc" class="fem">αἱ οἰκίαι</span>, their homes, and especially their <span lang="grc" class="neut">τό τεῖχος</span>, their wall.
		</p>
		<p style= "text-align:justify">
			However, when <span lang="grc" class="masc">οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι</span>, the Spartans, hear of this, they attempt to dissuade the Athenians from building a wall, for they fear the strength of Athens and the power of its newly acquired navy. Themistocles, an influential Athenian politician and general, refuses to stop the works on the wall and orders that all <span lang="grc" class="masc">οἱ πολῖται</span>, all citizens, including women and children, help rebuild it. He himself leaves immediately for Sparta in an attempt to cover up the rebuilding of the wall, knowing the Spartans would not be pleased if they found out the truth!
