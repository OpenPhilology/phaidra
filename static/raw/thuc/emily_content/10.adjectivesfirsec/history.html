			Under the Athenian military leader, <span class= "greek-text masc">Κίμων</span>, Cimon, the Athenians and the allies together defeat the Persians once again on the river Eurymedon. The Athenians also manage to suppress the revolt of the Thracians by defeating them at sea and landing on their island. However, they are defeated in Amphipolis while they attempt to advance further into Thrace. 
The defeated Thracians appeal to the Spartans, who, in turn, secretely promise to assist them by invading Attica, the region encompassing Athens. But Spartan aid is prevented by a terrible earthquake and by the revolt of the Helots. Without the help of the Spartans, the Thacians are, therefore, forced to surrender to <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι</span>, the Athenians.
