		<h4>How First and Second Declension Adjectives work</h4>
	
		<p style= "text-align: justify">
			Just like articles and nouns have gender, number and case, so do all the adjectives. Like the article, the adjective must <strong>agree</strong> in gender, number and case with the noun it describes. However, this does not mean that the ending of the article and that of the noun are always identical; there are exceptions where, though the adjective and noun agree, the endings might look different (e.g. <span class= "greek-text">ἄδικος ψυχή</span>, meaning <em>an unjust soul</em>).  

		<br></br>
			 Adjectives agreeing with first and second declension nouns fall into two groups:
			<ol>	
				<li><strong>three-ending adjectives</strong> with separate sets of endings for each of the three genders</li>
				<li><strong>two-ending adjectives</strong> with one set of endings for both masculine and feminine and another set for the neuter</li>
			</ol>
