		<h4>How First and Second Declension Adjectives work</h4>
	
		<p>
			Just like articles and nouns have gender, number and case, so do all the adjectives. Like the article, the adjective must agree in gender, number and case with the noun it agrees with. This doesn't mean that the ending of the article and that of the noun always be identical. 

		<br></br>
			Adjectives agreeing with first and second declension nouns fall into two groups:
			<ol>	
				<li><strong>three-ending adjectives</strong> with separate sets of endings for each of the three genders</li>
				<li><strong>two-ending adjectives</strong> with one set of endings for both masculine and feminine and another set for the neuter</li>
			</ol>
