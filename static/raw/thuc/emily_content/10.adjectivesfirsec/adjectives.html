		<h2>How First and Second Declension Adjectives work</h2>
		<p>Just like articles and nouns have gender, number and case, so do all the adjectives. Like the article, <strong>an adjective must agree in gender, number and case with the noun it describes</strong>.</p>
		<p>However, this does not mean that the ending of the article and that of the noun are always identical; there are exceptions where, though the adjective and noun agree, the endings might look different (e.g. <span class= "greek-text">ἄδικος ψυχή</span>, meaning <em>an unjust soul</em>).</p> 
		<p>Adjectives agreeing with first and second declension nouns fall into two groups:</p>

		<ul>	
			<li><strong>Three-ending Adjectives</strong><br>
				There are separate sets of endings for each of the three genders.<br><br>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Two-ending Adjectives</strong><br>
				Masculine and Feminine nouns share one set of endings, while neuter has a different set.<br><br>
			</li>
		</ul>
