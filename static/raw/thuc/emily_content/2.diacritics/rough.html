		<p>
			When you see this symbol <span lang="grc">῾</span> on top of the first letter of a word beginning with a vowel, the word is pronounced as though the first letter were preceded by an "H". This symbol <span lang="grc">῾</span> is called <strong>rough breathing</strong>.

			<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Useful tip!</h5>
			<strong>All words</strong> starting with the vowel <strong><span lang="grc">υ</span></strong> have a rough breathing. <strong>All words</strong> starting with <strong><span lang="grc">ρ</span></strong> also have a rough breathing, but in this case, as <span lang="grc">ρ</span> is a consonant and not a vowel, the breathing has no effect on how the word sounds.
