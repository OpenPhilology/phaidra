		<h2>Imperfect Indicative Active</h2>
	
		<p>As you now know:</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>The <strong>imperfect tense</strong> describes an action in the past with progressive aspect (i.e. the action took place over a period of time). </li>
				<li>The <strong>indicative mood</strong> is used for factual statements and questions.</li>
				<li>The <strong>active voice</strong> means the subject of the verb is performing the action.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Examples of the Imperfect in English</h3>

		<div class="well">
			<p>I <strong>was grading</strong> exams, when suddenly I heard thunder.</p>
			<p>Emily <strong>was drinking</strong> tea all morning.</p>
			<p>The ships <strong>were sailing</strong> at top speed.</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Notice how, in these examples, the verbs took place over a period of time &mdash; i.e. they express <strong>progressive aspect</strong>. If the sentences were simply "I graded exams", "Emily drank coffee", and "The ships sailed", their verbs would <em>not</em> belong in the Imperfect tense. This is because "graded", "drank", and "sailed" would indicate simple, one-time actions.

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<div class="bg-info">
			<h5>Keep an eye out!</h5>
			Remember that unlike English verbs, <strong>the subject of the Greek verb is implied by the verb's ending</strong>. Therefore, it is not necessary for it to be accompanied by the personal pronouns such as <em>I, You, He/She/It, We, You, They</em>.
