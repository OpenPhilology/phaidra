			The Spantans, finding it difficult to supress the revolt of the Helots on their own, call for Athenian help. Cimon and his troups are sent to help Sparta, but, upon their arrival, they are rudely dismissed by <span class= "greek-text masc">οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι</span>, the Spartans. This is because the Spartans are suddenly afraid that the Athenians, after having helped, might demand political changes. The Athenians take offence from this act and decide to renounce their alliance with Sparta in favor for one with Argos, Sparta's enemy!
