<h1> Declensions</h1>
<p>34. There are three DECLENSIONS, the First or A-Declension, the Second or O-Declension, and the
Third or Consonant Declension. The first two together are sometimes called the Vowel Declension, as
opposed to the Third.</p>
<p>35. The place of accent in the nominative singular of a noun or adjective must generally be
learned by observation. The other forms accent the same syllable as the nominative, if the last
syllable permits (21); otherwise the following syllable.</p>
<p>36. In the genitive and dative of all numbers a long ultima, if accented, takes the
circumflex.</p>
<h1>A-Declension.—Feminines in ᾱ.</h1>
<p>37. Nouns of the A-Declension end in ᾱ, η, or α (feminine), or in ᾱς or ης (masculine). Feminines
generally end in ᾱ, if ε, ι, or ρ precedes the ending.</p>
