    <h2>The Formation of Vowel Declension Adjectives</h2>
    <p>The masculine and neuter of these adjectives follow
        the O-Declension, the feminine the A-Declension. They are,
        therefore, said to be the Vowel Declension.</p>
    <p>If ε, ι, or ρ precedes ος, the nominative singular
        feminine ends in ᾱ, otherwise in η. </p>
    <p>The nominative, genitive, and vocative plural feminine follow the
        accent of the masculine, as ἄξιαι (meaning of equal worth, following the accent of ἄξιος, like ἄξιοι),
        not ἀξίαι (from the nominative singular ἀξίᾱ), and ἀξίων, not ἀξιῶν as in
        nouns of the A-Declension.</p>
    <p>Some adjectives of the Vowel Declension have the
        masculine and feminine alike, as ἄπορος, ἄπορος, ἄπορον,
        impassable, impracticable.</p>
