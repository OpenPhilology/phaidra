        <h2>The Second Aorist</h2>
        <p>Some verbs lack the first aorist. Such verbs often have a SECOND aorist, which ends in
            ον, and is conjugated exactly like the imperfect, as:</p>
        <p>ἄγω, ἔξω, second aorist ἤγαγον, I led, ἤγαγες, you led, ἤγαγε, he led, etc., </p>
        <p>ἕχω, ἕξω, second aorist ἔσχον, Ι had, ἔσχες, you had,ἔσχε, he had, etc.</p>
        <p>The breathing of the future ἕξω is irregular.</p>
        <p>The second aorist can be distinguished from the imperfect by the form of the stem. The
            imperfect is formed from the present stem (i.e. ἄγω), the aorist is formed from the
            aorist stem (i.e. ἤγαγον). From this point forward, the present, future and aorist forms
            of verbs will be given in the vocabulary and must be learned as part of the word.</p>
