        <h2>Compound Verbs</h2>
        <p> Compound verbs consist of a preposition and a simple verb. If the preposition ends in a
            vowel and the simple verb begins with one, the vowel of the preposition is generally
            elided. Compound verbs take the augment between the Preposition and the simple verb. It
            two vowels are thus brought together, the first is generally elided, as ἐπι-βουλεύω,
            plot against, imperfect ἐπ-εβούλευον.</p>
