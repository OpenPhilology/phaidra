<h1> Cases</h1>
<p>29. There are five CASES in Greek, the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and
vocative.</p>
<p>30. The nominative and vocative plural are always alike. In neuters, the nominative, accusative,
and vocative are alike in all numbers; in the plural these end in α.</p>
<p>In English, readers rely on the order that words appear in a sentence to indicate the grammatical
function of each word. In Ancient Greek, their case tells the reader the grammatical function of
each word in the sentence. </p>

<p>The nominative is used as the subject of the sentence and also as the object of sentences with
the verb 'to be'. </p>
<p>The genitive expresses the relationships between nouns and can usually be translated along with
the English word 'of' or 'from'.</p>
<p>The genitive also implies a separation of some kind. </p>
<p>The prepositions ἐκ, "from, out of " and ἀπό, "from, away from" take the genitive case. Thus, we
find ἐκ Σικιλίας, "out of Sicily," and ἀπὸ Σικελίας, "away from Sicily." If you wish to think about
the difference, you can imagine that ἐκ Σικιλίας implies movement that starts inside of Sicily and
moves out whereas ἀπὸ Σικελίας could describe a ship in the Mediterranean that is moving away from
Sicily.</p>
<p>The dative is used for three purposes: </p>

<ul>
<li>As the indirect object of a verb. The classic example is "giving" -- I give something
(accusative) to someone (someone goes in the dative). I give safety (accusative singular, σωτηρίαν)
to the oligarchy (dative singular, ὀλιγαρχίᾳ).</li>


<li>How or with what something is done.</li>
<li>Relationships of place where and time when. The preposition ἐν, "in, inside" governs the dative.
These relationships can be expressed by the English prepositions to or for, with or by, and in or
at. </li>
</ul>


<p>The accusative is the direct object of a transitive verb</p>
<p>The vocative is for exclamations and emphatic address.</p>
