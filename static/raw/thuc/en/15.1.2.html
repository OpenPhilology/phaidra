<h2>The Stems of ἄγω</h2>
<p>he present stem of ἄγω is ἄγ ο/ε (135); ἄγο occurs before μ or ν
    in the endings, elsewhere ἄγε. In the singular, the terminations ω, εις, ει,
    are difficult to analyze, but in the dual and plural, the tense stem and
    personal endings are easily distinguished. ἄγουσι is for ἄγο-νσι.</p>
<p>The future stem of ἄγω is ἄξ ο/ε, formed by adding the tense
    suffix σο or σε (σ ο/ε) to the verb stem.</p>
<p>The first perfect stem of ἄγω is ἦχα, formed by reduplicating
    the verb-stem ἄγ and adding the tense suffix κα. The endings μι and σι
    are dropped, and in the third singular final α is changed to ε. ἦχασι
    is for ἦχα-νσι.</p>
