        <h2>Formation of the Future Indicative and First Aorist Indicative</h2>
        <p>The future adds σω to the verb stem, the first aorist adds σα. The aorist, as a secondary
            tense, has augment.</p>
        <p>If the verb stem ends in a vowel, the stem may not be affected by the the addition of σω
            and σα, as λύ-ω, λύ-σω, ἔλῡ-σα; βουλλεύ-ω, βουλεύ-σω, ἐβούλευ-σα.</p>
        <p>If the verb stem ends in a mute, euphonic changes occur:</p>
        <p>1. A π-mute (π β φ) unites with σ and forms ψ, as πέμπ-ω, πέμψω (πεμπ-σω), ἔπεμψα
            (ἐπεμπ-σα).</p>
        <p>2. Α κ-mute ( κ γ χ) unites with σ and forms ξ, as διώκ-ω, pursue, διώξω (διωκ-σω),
            ἐδίωξα (ἐδιωκ-σα).</p>
        <p>3. A τ-mute (τ δ θ) before σ is dropped, as ἁρπάζω (verb stem ἁρπαδ), ἁρπάσω (ἁρπαδ-σω),
            ἥρπασα (ἡρπαδ-σα).</p>
