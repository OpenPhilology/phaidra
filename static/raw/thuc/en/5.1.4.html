        <h2>Tense</h2>
        <p>There are seven TENSES, the present, imperfect, future, aorist, perfect, pluperfect, and
            future perfect.</p>
        <p>The present tense is used to describe an ongoing action in the present time.</p>
        <p>The imperfect tense is used to describe an ongoing action in the past.</p>
        <p>The future is used to describe a simple or ongoing action in the future.</p>
        <p>The aorist tense is used to describe a simple action in the past.</p>
        <p>The perfect tense is used to describe a completed action in the present time.</p>
        <p>The pluperfect is used to describe a completed action in the past.</p>
        <p>The future perfect is used to describe a completed action in the future.</p>
