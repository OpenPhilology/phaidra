        <h2>Formation of the Imperfect Active Indicative</h2>
        <p>In the secondary tenses (50) of the indicative, the verb receives an AUGMENT ( i.e.
            increase) at the beginning.</p>
        <p>Augment is of two kinds:</p>
        <p>1. Syllabic augment, which prefixes ε to verbs beginning with a consonant, as λέγω,
            imperfect ἔ-λεγον, I was saying.</p>
        <p>2. Temporal augment, which lengthens the first syllable of verbs beginning with a vowel
            or diphthong, as ἄγω, imperfect ἦγον, I was leading. When augmented, α and ε become η;
            ι, ο, υ become ῑ, ω, ῡ; αι and ᾳ become ῃ; οι becomes ῳ.</p>
        <p>α.ἔχω irregularly has the imperfect εἶχον.</p>
        <p>The imperfect indicative represents an action as going on in past time, as ἔλεγον, I was
            saying or I said.</p>
