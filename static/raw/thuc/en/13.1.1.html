<h2>How to Read Ancient Greek</h2>
<p> In reading an inflected language, such as Greek, the
    knowledge of three things is absolutely necessary: first, of
    words; secondly, of forms; thirdly, of constructions.</p>
<p> The acquisition of this knowledge is gradual.</p>

<p>The pupil should commit thoroughly to memory the meaning of each new word as it occurs;
    he or she should learn the forms of the different cases, tenses, and numbers 
    accurately, the first time the paradigms occur, as to be able instantly to
    recognize these forms thereafter at sight; and as he or she reads, the student should carefully
    note the laws of construction, especially those which differ from the
    corresponding constructions in their own language.</p></body></html>
