        <h2 class="title2">What are the Perfect and the Pluperfect?</h2>
        <p>The perfect tense is used to describe completed action in the present time (i.e. I have
            studied Greek). The pluperfect tense is used to describe completed action in the past
            time (i.e. I had studied Greek).</p>
        <h2>Reduplication in the Perfect and the Pluperfect</h2>
        <p>The perfect and pluperfect, in all the moods, have a REDUPLICATION, which is the mark of
            completed action.</p>
        <p>Verbs beginning with a single consonant (except ρ) are reduplicated in the perfect by
            prefixing that consonant followed by ε, as λύω, λέ-λυκα. A rough mute (7) is changed to
            the cognate (8) smooth, as θύω, sacrifice, τέ-θυκα.</p>
        <p> In verbs beginning with two consonants (except a mute and a liquid), with a double
            consonant (ξ ψ ζ), or with ρ, the reduplication is represented by a simple ε, as
            στρατεύω, make an expedition, ἐστράτευκα.</p>
        <p>In verbs beginning with a short vowel or diphthong the reduplication has the form of the
            temporal augment (67, 2), as ἁρπάζω, ἥρπακα.</p>
        <p>When the reduplicated perfect begins with a consonant, the pluperfect prefixes the
            syllabic augment ε to the reduplication, as λέλυκα, ἐλελύκη. In other cases the
            pluperfect generally keeps the reduplication of the perfect without change, as ἥρπακα,
            ἡρπάκη.</p>
