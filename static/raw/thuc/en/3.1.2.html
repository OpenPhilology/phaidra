<h4>Genders</h4>
<p>There are three GENDERS, the <strong>masculine</strong>, the <strong>feminine</strong>, and the <strong>neuter</strong>.</p>
<p>As in Latin, names of males and of rivers, winds and months are masculine; names of
	females and of countries, towns, trees, and islands, and most nouns denoting qualities
	or conditions are feminine.</p>
