<h4>More on Case</h4>
<p>
	The <strong>case</strong> of a Greek noun indicates its grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence (e.g. subject, direct object, etc.). To change a noun from one case into an other, you must use the <strong>stem</strong> of the noun and append <strong>endings</strong> based on the declension to which it belongs. 
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
	Before we go into forming Greek nouns, take a look at the various functions nouns can perform and which cases those functions belong to. Each case will be covered in more detail later.
