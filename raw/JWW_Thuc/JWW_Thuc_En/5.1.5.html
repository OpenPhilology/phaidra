        <h2>Voice</h2>
        <p>The Greek verb has three VOICES, the active, middle, and passive.</p>
        <p>The active voice is used when the subject of the sentence is the agent of the action
            described in the verb.</p>
        <p>The middle voice denotes that the subject is both an agent of an action and somehow
            concerned with the action.</p>
        <p>The passive voice is used to show that the subject of the verb is acted on.</p>
