        <h2>Mood</h2>
        <p>There are four MOODS, the indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative. These are
            the finite moods. To them are added, in the conjugation of the verb, the infinitive and
            participles.</p>
        <p>The indicative is the most common verb form you will encounter. It is used for simple
            statements and questions.</p>
        <p>The subjunctive and optative are used in contexts to denote prohibitions, conditions,
            purpose, and suppositions. These will be covered in more detail beginning in lesson
            thirty-three.</p>
        <p>The imperative is used to give orders and commands</p>
        <p>The infinitive has voice and tense but not person and number. It is translated with the
            English word "to ...". i.e. ἔχειν is the infinitive form of the verb ἔχω and it
            is translated "to have."</p>
        <p>The participle is a verbal noun that is translated with the English ending -ing.
               i.e. ἔχων is the participle of the verb and it is translated "having".</p>
