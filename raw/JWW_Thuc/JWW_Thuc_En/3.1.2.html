        <h1>Genders</h1>
        <p>32. There are three GENDERS, the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.</p>
        <p>33. As in Latin, names of males and of rivers, winds and months are masculine; names of
            females and of countries, towns, trees, and islands, and most nouns denoting qualities
            or conditions are feminine.</p>
